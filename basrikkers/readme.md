# Assessment 1
#### making your own chart with the skills i've learned

## Background.
In my assessment i've visualized a dataset. I could chose from 3 sets: Temperature.csv, Languages.tsv and Toilets.json. I decided to visualize temperature.csv.

I've edited a [line chart](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245).
I've took the following steps:

* semantic
* Changed code to my own style
* data load: tsv to csv
* Understand the code
* changed the timeparse to match my dataset
* edited my scale for a better looking graph.
* edited the css
* add title

## Features
* d3-dsv - parse tab-separated values
* d3-time-format - date parsing and formatting
* d3-scale - position encodings
* d3-array - data processing
* d3-axis - axes
* d3-shape - lines

added features:
* d3-max - maximum value
